<p>All members of the research group are required to agree with the <a href="/manual/coc">code of conduct</a>.</p>

<h1 id="katys-responsibilities">Katy’s Responsibilities</h1>

<p>As your PI, it is my responsibility to do a number of things.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be supportive:</strong> to the best of my ability or connect you to the support <br />
you need. Universities are places of growth and challenge. I recognize that <br />
times will occasionally be dark or overwhelming. Throughout your group <br />
membership, I will match your dedication to your success with support to the <br />
best of my ability. When that is insufficient, I am also responsible for <br />
pointing you toward external resources and helping you to formulate a plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Pursue funding:</strong> to support our work on ambitious projects toward the <br />
missions of the group. If funding is going to lapse, I will provide fair <br />
warning.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentor:</strong> students in their path to becoming independent scientists. I will <br />
strive to help you ask questions, engage the scientific literature, and <br />
design scientific work.</li>
  <li><strong>Guide Research:</strong> in both large-scale and small-scale ways. I will help students <br />
to select PhD or Masters projects at the larger scale. At the smaller scale, <br />
I will help to guide short term progress toward those accomplishments.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide feedback:</strong> in a timely manner on your research work, research <br />
direction, written products, presentations, software design, data analysis, <br />
career goals, and anything else of relevance to our collaboration.</li>
  <li><strong>Run interference:</strong> so that students and staff can be protected from the <br />
bulk of administrative and paperwork responsibilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign stuff:</strong> On a related note, I’ll sign stuff when you need it signed. <br />
Just ask.</li>
  <li><strong>Help to define and enforce timelines:</strong> toward prompt completion of work. <br />
That is, while not all researchers want or need externally enforced deadlines <br />
and specifically defined goals, many thrive when periodic expectations drive <br />
them to complete work on schedule. Unless you prefer a hands-off approach, I <br />
expect to help you to define your goals and hold you responsible for them on <br />
a timeline that is feasible but ambitious.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide course guidance:</strong> so that students can pursue courses<br />
that benefit their research while accomplishing college and <br />
departmental requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide space and supplies:</strong> including a physical working space, <br />
furniture, necessary computational resources, and virtual resources such as <br />
software licenses.</li>
  <li><strong>Support conference travel:</strong> when funding is available and students have <br />
work to present, I feel strongly that students should be given the <br />
opportunity to travel to technical conferences both nationally and <br />
internationally.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect you to my network:</strong> whenever possible. I will connect students to <br />
my professional network when it may be helpful to students as they seek out <br />
external experts, additional mentors, summer internships, and careers.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct Publication Efforts:</strong> by helping group members to identify and pursue <br />
publication-worthy work, helping to write and edit manuscripts, and guiding <br />
the submission process.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="postdoc-responsibilities">Postdoc Responsibilities</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be present:</strong> I expect you to be accessible during normal working hours. <br />
Feel free to follow a schedule that works for you, work from home once in a <br />
while when you need to, and take breaks when you want to. But, by default, <br />
plan to come to the office during the daytime with regularity.  I won’t track <br />
your hours, but I will worry if I haven’t seen your face all week.</li>
  <li><strong>Be productive</strong> by writing papers and contributing to software toward the <br />
missions of the group, the advancement of science in your field, building <br />
your career, and expanding your expertise.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide expertise:</strong> I and my graduate students are relying on you to be an <br />
expert in your work and to share that expertise during collaboration. This <br />
may take the form of presenting at lab meetings, providing feedback to <br />
graduate students, or taking leadership in scholarly work.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> I very much hope that you will involve other members of the <br />
research group (myself included) in the work that you do as a postdoc. We are <br />
ready to share our effort, support, expertise, feedback, and ideas.</li>
  <li><strong>Support:</strong> both graduate and undergraduate students by providing leadership <br />
in collaborative work.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="graduate-student-responsibilities">Graduate Student Responsibilities</h1>

<p>Students who are my advisees have many responsibilities to themselves, to me, and to one another.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stay in good standing:</strong> with the graduate school by meeting graduate <br />
school requirements, filling out paperwork on time, registering for classes <br />
on time, completing milestones satisfactorily, passing any qualifying exams,<br />
and scheduling committee meetings annually.</li>
  <li><strong>Be responsible:</strong> for informing yourself about graduation requirements, <br />
departmental deadlines, career opportunities, and anything else that might <br />
impact your standing.</li>
  <li><strong>Have a plan:</strong> It is your responsibility to work with Katy to identify a <br />
research topic, identify research milestones and goals, plan your timeline <br />
toward progress, plan for conference submissions, prepare for manuscript <br />
submissions, prepare for your thesis proposals and defenses, etc. Get a <br />
calendar, consider a task manager, create a GANTT chart… whatever works for <br />
you. If at some point it seems like you don’t have a plan, I will suggest all <br />
of these things.</li>
  <li><strong>Be resourceful:</strong> toward your independence as a researcher. You should <br />
actively explore the literature in your field, seek out solutions to your <br />
challenges, study independently in order to fill gaps in your own knowledge, <br />
and take the initiative to <em>try things out</em> when you’re curious to see what <br />
happens.</li>
  <li><strong>Prioritize research:</strong> by dedicating time and attention to it as you would <br />
a job. Your research support is tied to your research duties just as a <br />
paycheck is tied to a job.</li>
  <li><strong>Graduate promptly:</strong> I expect MS students to take two years and PhD students to <br />
take less than five years to complete all requirements and thesis defenses. <br />
Of course there may be exceptions, but extenuating circumstances should be <br />
communicated well in advance. My role includes helping you to formulate a <br />
feasible thesis project. Yours, in turn, includes meeting the goals of that <br />
project or communicating when those deadlines are infeasible.</li>
  <li><strong>Submit weekly reports:</strong> these brief updates should note your completed <br />
progress, insights you’ve gained from reading, tables and charts you may have <br />
created, your plans for next week, any challenges to your progress, and <br />
anything else Katy should know to interpret your progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with Katy:</strong> regularly about your progress, your lack of <br />
progress, your challenges, your needs, your strengths, your weaknesses, and <br />
anything else that impacts my ability to support you in your pursuit of a <br />
graduate degree.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with your colleagues:</strong> regularly concerning relevant <br />
collaboration progress, challenges, and insights that impact the integrated <br />
success of the group.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> with other members of the group. Group members should strive <br />
to work collaboratively with one another toward the <br />
<a href="/manual/mission">mission</a> rather than in competition.</li>
  <li><strong>Attend group meetings:</strong> these will take place as often as once a week and <br />
graduate students are expected to attend and regularly present their work <br />
within these meetings.</li>
  <li><strong>Be on time:</strong> to meetings, because to do otherwise signals disrespect to <br />
your colleagues. Consistent lateness will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li><strong>Be present:</strong> I expect you to be accessible during normal working hours.  <br />
Feel free to follow a schedule that works for you, work from home once in a <br />
while when you need to, focus on coursework when that needs to take priority, <br />
read for exams, and take breaks when you want to. But, by default, plan to <br />
come to the office during the daytime with regularity.  I won’t track your <br />
hours, but I will worry if I haven’t seen your face all week.</li>
  <li><strong>Participate:</strong> actively in the university and the department, attending <br />
colloquia, workshops, and other professional, technical, and departmental <br />
events when they are relevant to your work and professional growth. Of <br />
course, participate within reason, as prioritizing research remains a key <br />
responsibility as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask questions:</strong> in talks, in meetings, and any time there is an <br />
opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are not explicitly required, but are strongly encouraged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proactively apply:</strong> for fellowships, scholarships, and awards.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentor undergraduates:</strong> when they need leadership from you in order to be <br />
productive, contributing members of the research group.</li>
  <li><strong>Be involved:</strong> in professional societies, educational efforts, and other <br />
service activities that enrich your life as a scientist and improve your <br />
professional and technical network.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="undergraduate-responsibilities">Undergraduate Responsibilities</h1>
