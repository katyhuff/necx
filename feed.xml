        <title>Jin Whan Bae Recognized for Outstanding Undergraduate Research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ARFC graduate student, &lt;strong&gt;Jin Whan Bae&lt;/strong&gt;, Teddy for short, will be recognized this &lt;br /&gt;
month with the &lt;strong&gt;2017 Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering Outstanding &lt;br /&gt;
Undergraduate Research Award.&lt;/strong&gt;  Teddy has been invited to attend the Department &lt;br /&gt;
Honors and Awards Banquet on April 13th, where he will formally receive his &lt;br /&gt;
award.  This recognition consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and a &lt;br /&gt;
listing on a plaque that is permanently displayed in Talbot Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2016, Teddy was an undergraduate researcher in ARFC. This semester he&lt;br /&gt;
is completing his undergraduate degree while beginning his first semester as a&lt;br /&gt;
graduate student in ARFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is being recognized for his significant achievements in research as an&lt;br /&gt;
undergraduate. In particular, in Fall 2016, Teddy led a project to quantify the&lt;br /&gt;
feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of a creative disposal concept.  For this&lt;br /&gt;
work, Teddy consulted technically with Prof. Huff as well as key NPRE experts, &lt;br /&gt;
Dr. William  Roy and Prof. Cliff Singer. This work culminated in a paper &lt;br /&gt;
submission to the International High-Level Radioactive Waste Management &lt;br /&gt;
Conference (IHLRWM2017).  This paper, “Benefits of Siting a Borehole Repository &lt;br /&gt;
on Non-Operating Nuclear Facility,” was exceptional work and was &lt;br /&gt;
enthusiastically accepted.  Expert reviewers said about this paper “Wonderful &lt;br /&gt;
paper! Publish basically as is.” and “This is an excellent paper that maps out &lt;br /&gt;
an entirely plausible new way to look at nuclear waste storage in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students. We especially congratulate &lt;br /&gt;
Teddy on this award as it recognizes a core value of our research group: &lt;br /&gt;
exceptional scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kathryn Mummah Rakes in Awards</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Senior ARFC undergraduate Kathryn Mummah, Katie for short, has recently received &lt;br /&gt;
honors from the Roy G. Post Foundation as well as a Knights of St. Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is the University of Illinois’ first recipient of a Roy G. Post Foundation &lt;br /&gt;
undergraduate scholarship and has been invited to attend the Waste Management &lt;br /&gt;
Symposium in Arizona, March 5-9, in order to receive her award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when The Knights of St. Patrick of the University of Illinois &lt;br /&gt;
announced their award recipients (by covertly decorating the Grainger Library &lt;br /&gt;
with St. Patrick’s Day ephemera), Katie was among the short list of 2017 &lt;br /&gt;
honorees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students and we congratulate &lt;br /&gt;
Katie on both of these awards which give, in their own way, special recognition &lt;br /&gt;
of her outstanding record of service and academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Group Members Join ARFC</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the first semester of the ARFC group begins this fall, I’m excited to &lt;br /&gt;
announce that a number of researchers will join the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Lindsay will be joining us a postdoctoral scholar. He received his&lt;br /&gt;
undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Washington&lt;br /&gt;
and received his PhD this summer from North Carolina State University. He will&lt;br /&gt;
be joining ARFC as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/&quot;&gt;Data Exploration Laboratory&lt;br /&gt;
(DXL)&lt;/a&gt; led by Matthew Turk. His activities will&lt;br /&gt;
emphasize open source advanced reactor multiphysics and his collaboration with&lt;br /&gt;
DXL may advance visual exploration of simulation results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrei Rykhlevskii will be joining the group as a PhD student. He has a degree&lt;br /&gt;
in Nuclear Engineering from Bauman Moscow State Technical University as well as&lt;br /&gt;
a Masters of Science in Finanace from the Financial University in Moscow. His&lt;br /&gt;
work will likely also emphasize open source advanced reactor multiphysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a small team of undergraduate researchers will join the group &lt;br /&gt;
this year.  These include Kathryn Mummah and Jin Whan Bae of NPRE as well as &lt;br /&gt;
Matthew Worley and Yukun Tan who will join us through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/&quot;&gt;NCSA &lt;br /&gt;
SPIN&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of all of these researchers, I expect ARFC will really be able to&lt;br /&gt;
hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Huff Plans to Join NPRE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am thrilled to be joining the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as &lt;br /&gt;
an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma and Radiological &lt;br /&gt;
Engineering. I was honored to have been awarded a Blue Waters Assistant &lt;br /&gt;
Professorship as well as an affiliate faculty appointment with the National &lt;br /&gt;
Center for Supercomputing Applications. The support of NCSA is very meaningful &lt;br /&gt;
to me and I hope to make important use of the high performance computing &lt;br /&gt;
resources on campus when I arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will begin my appointment on August 16, 2016. Until then, I’ll be wrapping up &lt;br /&gt;
my work at the University of California, Berkeley. In addition, I’ll be &lt;br /&gt;
preparing my first NPRE course, seeking graduate students and postdocs for a &lt;br /&gt;
research group, finding a home in the Urbana-Champaign area, and setting up &lt;br /&gt;
this website.&lt;/p&gt;
